# README

This project is an Event Planner application that uses React.JS for the Front End and Rails on the Backend. The Rails API is hit by React to render data to an individual on the Client side.

React has been predicted by many to be a framework of the future so I decided to give it a try. Even though I know Swift I was interested in practicing with React due to the fact that many people use it for mobile application development.

There are some cool features like a search feature and the ability to add a new Event on the Front End side. The API can also be viewed, I chose to build it in JSON.
